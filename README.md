what i have done here is a simple biography of one of the most successful surgeons in Egypt and the entire globe.
i've tried to cover as much as i can all about his personal information, early and later career, and awards he had recieved.
At home page, we can see a navigation bar containing links to website pages and mobile responsive side bar, a div contains biography of Dr Magdi along with photo of him, and a table containing other basic informations.
page 2 contains all about Professor's early career and education.
page 3 contains informations about Professor's personal life and later career.
finally, we have got all the awards the professor has recieved at page 4.
