        <span class="head">Early life and education</span> Magdi Habib Yacoub was born in November 1935 in Bilbeis, El Sharqia, Egypt to Coptic Christian family, and spent his childhood moving around a number of different small towns. His father was a surgeon, who later worked in public health. He died in 1958. Yacoub later recalled that both his father and the death of his youngest aunt at age 22 years from an uncorrected mitral stenosis during childbirth inspired him to study medicine and cardiology, saying that “this young woman would not have died if we had had access to facilities which were then available in a few centres around the world”.
              At the age of 15, he entered the University of Cairo College of Medicine with a scholarship.

        <span class="head">Personal and family</span> He is married to Marianne and they have three children and a number of grandchildren. Yacoub enjoys swimming, listening to classical music and growing orchids.

      <div class="bio">
        <span class="head">Later career</span> He retired from the National Health Service in 2001 at the age of 65.
        In 2006 he led a complex operation which required removing a transplant heart from a person whose own heart had recovered. The original heart had not been removed during transplant surgery nearly a decade earlier, in the hope it might recover.
        In April 2007, it was reported that a British medical research team led by Yacoub had grown part of a human heart valve from stem cells.

      <div class="bio" id="charities">
        <span class="head">Charities</span> In 1995, Yacoub founded the charity "Chain of Hope", through which he continued to operate on children, and through which the provision of heart surgery for correctable heart defects are made possible in areas without specialist cardiac surgery units.
        He is also the head of the Magdi Yacoub Global Heart Foundation, co-founded with Ahmed Zewail and Ambassador Mohamed Shaker in 2008, which launched the Aswan Heart project and founded the Aswan Heart Centre the following year.
